For example, change tranmission parameters of nodes. To accomplish this task we also needed to make some changes on the NS3 simulator to be able to modify some parameters for the particular problem we ar dealing with.\r\nAfter implementing the system, we have also define a a set of rules to find a solution to the problem and tested them on different scenarios.\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
